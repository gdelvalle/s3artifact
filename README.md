s3artifact
=========
Implements necessary parts of the s3 API to upload a file and make it publicly readable.

### Use Case 
See the name.  To expound, if you are in CI build env customized for go compilation, adding something like python and aws-cli is not very practical, or its certainly not the shortest path between points. This solved for that very niche need.

### Install

Clone repo Run 'make && sudo make install'
